# Operating-System-Engineering
 This semester (Spring 2020), I am taking a OS implementation class at Technion university under Prof. Dan Tsafrir guide. The class is based on material of MIT 6.828. We are going to write an exokernel-style operating systems kernel names JOS under x86 platform and then port it to ARM architecture. This repository is here to record all the labs we did during the semester.
